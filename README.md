How does github work? i need to know
Well explain:
in git cmd:
cd .. to move up the folder
cd *filename* to move up the folder
always first go to the correct directory
in the right?: git clone URL
git add *file name* or -a to add files
then, git commit -m "MSG" to commit your file
then git push to push changes to github

If you want to sync, use git pull
